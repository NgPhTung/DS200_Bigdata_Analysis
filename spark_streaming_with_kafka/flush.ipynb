      "Sent: 0,Waqqas Hanafi,\"Fresh\" vegetarian spring rolls were dry (the skin was like chewing through leathery dry paper) and, well, not fresh at all. Can't believe I'm sitting in Saigon having one of the worst spring rolls I've ever had. Disappointing. The menu seems overpriced - which makes sense, since this is in the heart of the touristy area. The service was cold but efficient. The interior is basic and functional.\n",
      "Sent: 1,Clara Hadiwijoto (Clara),Food was meh. We got spring rolls but for some reason it feels so dry Place was nicely decorated Price was written in VND and USD and imo it was definitely overpriced\n",
      "Sent: 2,Kristjan Malva,Food was delightful! Restaurant was crowded so very few servants. Our waiter did not understand us very well so we had to point at the menu and send one food back to the kitchen because he got one thing wrong. I think it was some kind of public holiday the next day so we could not get coffee because they were hurry to close the restaurant. Otherwise would recommend after the Ben Thanh Market visit. Prices are very european and drinks are also nice.\n",
      "Sent: 3,colette wong,Such a delightful restaurant with amazing Vietnamese food. We ordered Vietnamese rolls, chicken and beef pho and they were incredible.  Sat inside but we had a look around the restaurant after and saw they had lovely Al fresco dining too! Their cocktail menu looked good too. Great place for a night out.\n",

      "Sent: 5,T C,Dined here 3 times on their gorgeous little balcony during my stay in HCM. Wonderful foods served in Vietnamese traditional chinaware with a lot of options to choose from even my ridiculous non foodie friend enjoyed a few items here. Horrible choice of music. Total of 5 songs being played all over again and again, not to mention they were all bad covers from western artists, literally a torture chamber to the ears. As a foreigner I would have liked if they played Vietnamese music instead. Overall, this restaurant was great after a few exhausting hours shopping at Ben Thanh market :)\n",

We were surprised the \"manager\" thought maybe we planted them or they just magically crawled on it... No, that's straight from the kitchen.\n",
      "Sent: 12,L C,We were given outdoor seating with adult high chairs even though we have a child with us. The table was shaky and unbalanced. Totally not a kid-friendly restaurant. They have indoor seatings available but we were told that they were all 'Reserved'. Staff are not trained even though we told them the table was shaky and yet still placed the food on the table. Neither the staffs can understand basic English. One of the dishes ordered was 10 oysters, 1 of it was bad. And we tried communicating to the staff, staff replied said ok. We communicated to a black shirt (probably a higher rank), she went and came back replying 'thank you for your feedback.' We were so frustrated to the point, we ate and left to pay the 1,600,000+ vnd bill. Spoke to the cashier about the oyster, she blamed the staff saying the staff came back to tell her we said ok. We were like 'You know what, it's ok. I just want to pay and get the hell out of here, never coming back!' And she insisted on giving us 40,000 vnd off the bill, which we rejected. It's not about the money. We came here for food, service and atmosphere. Everything was ruined, unpleasant and total discomfort.\n",
      "Sent: 13,Mark L,Just eaten here based on seeing the reviews. Food was OK, staff lacked experience and was all a bit frantic. As nice as they were could not recommend to anyone. Sorry about that - still washing my hands as side of tables were slightly sticky too. Location is nice but that is all I can say\n",

We ordered  expensive drinks, one with alcohol, one without because Im allergic to it. Sadly they put alcohol in both drinks and Im glad that I took my medicine otherwise I would be dead already! Then they try to correct it and brought me a drink with 90% ice and 10% drink. After 5 min they asked us to pay because they are closing soon (it was 8.45) ??????? Of course we go because who gonna treat costumer like this and dont feel bad almost killing someone??? Woooow... while leaving I asked the security guard again how long this place is open and he still said 10/11 pm SO SAD. GUYS as a Vietnamese I would never recommend this over expensive -for tourist only- place and be carefull what you are drinking!!\n",
      "Sent: 18,Gautham,Disappointing dessert. Ordered the yogurt with fruit.  There was almost no fruit…. Just yogurt with ice and very little fruit.

It's a perfect table choice for a cold beer or even a full lunch/dinner. Food was delicious and reasonably priced in central District 1 . Highly recommend the unique chicken and ambarella's leaves salad. Staff was attentive and polite. In general we had great dining experience here. Likely to be back next time\n",

Food is good though the portion are not very big so if you're a big eater be aware. The view is nice and they're open later than some restaurants around here so this is very good.\n",
      "Sent: 23,Dinesh De Silva,Nice architecture blends with the help of historical values of Vietnam. Great atmosphere with lot of greenery and foliage although restaurant located on the first floor. Nice food and we enjoyed eating the stir fired assorted mushrooms and grilled squid with salt and chilies.  Place is not crowded but thought the service could have been better. Overall a nice place to chill out .\n",

      "Sent: 25,Emily May,Four of us came to Soul Ben Thanh Restaurant & Bar in Ho Chi Minh. We were keen to have some good Vietnamese food, but didn't anticipate how expensive the food would ultimately be. We had a brief moment of panic when out hotpot flame wouldn't go down, and we were at risk of burning something. But the waiter attended to us quickly to resolve the issue. The rooftop bar had a great view overlooking the streets of Ho Chi Minh, the food was delicious and I really enjoyed my beef noodle dish. Just be aware that if you are coming here for dinner, be prepared to spend upwards of three or four times more than a local street meal.\n",

      "Sent: 31,GrexXes Sheep,We came to this restaurant because of how great the review was but we were disappointed with a lousy experience eating lunch at this place. The food was super expensive. We ordered 6 dishes like spring rolls and pho but it costs us like 1,500,000 dong. I am not sure if this is normal but it is definitely on the expensive side. I don’t mind to pay this price if the taste and experience is good but the food was either average or below average. However, the worst was their service!!! The service that annoys us about was: 1. It was slow. It took close to an hour from ordering to serving the food. 2. Half an hour after we order, they came to us saying that there is no ingredient for one of our drinks. It took them half an hour to make a juice when there was not many customers at 2-3pm?! 3. The staff passing us kept on hitting the chairs of the other tables, creating so much noise and disruption. The path from the serving table to the kitchen is quite wide, so I don’t understand why they can’t walk straight?? 4. When we paid, our card got declined once and we want to try paying using the same card, but the cashier looks super annoyed. Like What the heck? I do not recommend this restaurant, and I will not come back! Worst service ever!!!\n",
      "Sent: 32,inthasorn maya,It was very great fulfilling. The view the temperature the staff is very great. I was actually willing to go last time I came here, unfortunately I was full so I was regrettably give up. One thing I surprise was the size of ice. I order beer with ice and water with ice. For the beer they bring big ice to less melt away, for the water they put lots to get cool rapidly. Also the food, it was fabulous and great full taste in my opinion the hongkong flavor fish it was my no1 favorite in this restaurant. I really enjoy it\n",

Food is ok. I tried starfruit prawn soup for 1st time. Very appetising. Did not eat much. So cant really rate them.\n",
      "Sent: 38,Ruby,We (3 people) went to this restaurant recommended by an employee of a Vietnamese restaurant in Landmark 81, then we came and we had some real experiences like this: My vegetarian noodles is very amazing but for two left dishes we were so disappointed. First, Grilled pork ribs with BBQ sauce, the sauce my friend said yummy but for the ribs, the meat around the bone is empty, only bones and the price is 250k, is this fair for a dishes like this? Absolutely no. And for the left dishes, Stir-fried beef with fries, the fries are yummy and amazing but again, this meat in this dishes is very chewy and it's like we're chewing gums. So by the way, we said to the owner and waiters to fix this problem, my friends are angry but for me I don't say anything not nicely, I only give true feedbacks from my friends and from me to the restaurant. So hopefully you guys can make the food the best in the next time we visit and get our feedbacks to improve the food. Thank you very much!🙏🙏🙏🙏\n",

However it was in a nice location. With AC and beautiful view of the street. The service and staffs were friendly and attentive. They can speak English also if you need to order in English. Definitely a good place to get away from the heat.\n",
      "Sent: 45,Max Connolley,Waited 20 mins for our cocktail. Then waited another 10 mins for the bill before we got up to pay. Vat is not included and therefore everything costs 15% more than what is advertised. Cocktails come to around £8/9 . Extremely poor service for how much you pay - very disappointing\n",

We cancelled our order in the end as they told us we would have to wait a further 5 mins, in what time again, other people received their drinks and food before us.\n",

It was dry and stiff.\n",

      "Sent: 63,Jonah Scriven,For a restaurant with such good reviews I was expecting a lot more. The food was below average, I ate the seafood stir fry which had very chewy squid and completely tasteless everything else. My girlfriend ordered the vegetarian fresh spring rolls which was served with fish sauce of all things, which they then refused to swap. They have a very wide selection of drinks which was impressive, about 30 different cocktails, plus many beers wines and spirits. I had the Soul Pink Beer Cocktail which, while it was about as good as I expected a beer cocktail to be, it was an interesting experience and the highlight of my meal. Our waiter was very nice and spoke good English, though he was quite clumsy, spilling my drink and leaving the bottle opener on the table, and disappearing whenever we needed him. The other staff seemed to be play-fighting next to our table which was very strange and distracting, they also seemed to be bullying our nice waiter sadly, perhaps he was new and they were taking the piss. All in all, not a very good experience for by far the highest price on a meal thus far in our trip, will not be returning.\n",
      "Sent: 64,Zo Krec,Tourist trap with a poor service. However, the worst is extremely arrogant management. You cannot imagine that those people are that level arrogant while they try to be too smart in conversation. Unbelievable level of arrogance. Avoid this place at any cost. There are too many better options around.\n",

Good restaurants Before like Ngoc Chau Garden and Hoi An restaurant in Saigon. Have yet to try Bep me In but would be hoping that would be very decent food. Soul restaurant is a scam. If only had read the other reviews would not have entered. These people cannot cook and prepare food. Ordered salad: very plain, missing lots of natural salad missing. Ordered a chicken dish that's where it completely went wrong. They served tiny pieces of factory chicken drenched in oil with onions. Tradidional Vietnamese restaurants serve Ga Ta which is garden chicken. I asked for it to be replaced by another dish and he waiter said yes. Then that never came. I asked for the bill and they tried to charge me for the chicken dish. No way. This restaurant should close down or change ownership. It is a scam. This is not traditional Vietnamese food. Any Vietnamese person that visits here will agree. The decor is nice, the setting is good. The presentation is good. The food they serve is absolutely terrible. The price of drinks: Tiger Crystal 50k plus 15%. Water = 25k plus 15%. The chicken dish was about 170k plus 15%. Horrible experience.\n",

On the positive side, the building itself is quite nice, and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, I did feel that the flavors were a bit too westernized and didn't have the authentic taste that I was hoping for in a bhan mi sandwich. Overall, while the building and atmosphere were nice, the lackluster flavors and flat beer were disappointing. I would recommend that the restaurant work on improving the flavor profiles of their dishes and ensuring that the beer is served at the appropriate temperature and carbonation level. Additionally, I hope that they can find a way to balance their western influences with the traditional flavors of bhan mi to create a more authentic and satisfying experience for their customers.\n",

The staff changed the menu one time and what’s funny is that she came after 50minutes and came to say they are out of the food. AFTER 50 MINUTE WAITING! 3. The card doesn’t work. Waited another ten minutes to pay… A total nightmare. Don’t go here.\n",

The service was impeccable. The staff was not only knowledgeable about the menu but also genuinely passionate about creating a memorable experience. They accommodated my dietary preferences with grace and ensured every detail was perfect. [Your Restaurant Name] is a hidden gem that every tourist should discover.

      "Sent: 223,T Z,Food was mediocre. We walked in hoping for good Vietnamese food since this restaurant was highly rated on google. However we were so surprised by the underwhelming food. Everything tasted like it was defrosted from a frozen microwave meal. They served our food with fries and hot sauce which was weird. They then gave us the vegetarian spring rolls which was full of starch and tasted worse than a microwave meal spring roll. The honey garlic chicken we ordered was so dry and the sauce just tasted like ketchup. The fried rice we got came with soy sauce… must I say more? I have never received fried rice with soy sauce on the side. It tasted like something I made at home when I was a child. At the end of our meal when we were paying, the server kept on asking how was the meal, how did it taste, etc. at first I replied it was ok to be civil, but after countless number of times asking, I just told her it was bad. She then looked extremely concerned. I am surprised that a Vietnamese server is concerned that I did not like the food. The price of the dishes were not cheap either. This meal was more expensive than other meals we’ve had that were way more delicious. Overall, do not fall for this tourist trap, as it is an overpriced meal of microwave frozen food.\n",

      "Sent: 229,James Buntain,The food was delicious and a lot of fun for my partner and I. The wait staff were helpful and very friendly to us as well. Highly recommend anyone local or tourist to come here. A great experience to be had for all, especially when you need a break from the local markets.\n",
      "Sent: 230,Kyla Bryant-Spreckley,Lovely and friendly staff. Good prices. Nice location.\n",
      "Sent: 231,Robin Roots,Main arrived before starter, one drink arrived even later. Chicken was very dry. Fried rice with beef was also dry and tasteless. Friendly staff but we were left alone and forgotten after taking order. Nice terrace tho!\n",
      "Sent: 232,Nieka P,There are not many places that are open after 11 PM, so we decided to come here. We ordered vegetarian fried rice & noodles. The noodles were very tasty, but while eating I discovered a rubber band... The staff handled it quite well, they apologized and made the dish again. Nevertheless, the rubber band was an uncomfortable discovery\n",
      "Sent: 233,Matus Toth,Lovely lunch, awesome taste and perfect service\n",
      "Sent: 234,Peter Cockerell,Really disappointing. The \"come-on\" menu outside was totally different from the actual menu. The staff were friendly but totally inept. The waitress who took our drinks order (two smoothies) came back 5 minutes later asking for the order again because she'd \"lost\" it, even though she had the paper with the order on in her hand! Different wait-staff kept trying to take our food and drink orders multiple times. The smoothies took an age to arrive and were very mediocre. The three food items arrived over a long period, from slow-ish to very slow. The place wasn't busy at all when we ordered. The food itself was, again, just so-so. The seafood in my banh xeo was obviously the worst kind of frozen processed shrimp etc with barely any flavor. The pancake itself was paper thin. The two beef dishes were similarly mediocre. Nothing about the experience justifies the exorbitant prices they charge. It's just a tourist trap, and the only reason we ended up there at 10pm was that the night food market has closed down, and the pizza place opposite (which was good when I was there 3 years ago) had a 40-minute wait. There were precious few other options at that time of night. Edit to add: They also added a 5% service charge. For a party of three, really?\n",
      "Sent: 235,Véronique Benoy,The location is really nice, as you have a nice view over ben thanh. The food and service were good — quick, kind & yummy :))\n",
      "Sent: 236,Naso Evangelou-Oost,Bean was great service, great food, very friendly ! 😁\n",
      "Sent: 237,Nands,The food you get and the pictures are totally different. I was extremely disappointed when i got the food. The portion is extremely small and totally not worth the price. The food taste rather subpar and  the boiled pork texture was so hard. Overall, a tourist trap. The manager was too pushy with her recommendations. The staffs are not attentive. I will not be visiting again.\n",
      "Sent: 238,Chee Siong Seah,Best place to view Ben Thanh market with bitexco 😊\n",

      "Sent: 243,vincenzo roccara squarcialupi brancaleone,extremely average food and tiny portions. Prices are very overpriced designed for tourist traps. Avoid at all cost, 5 day old mcdonald’s leftover is much better\n",

      "Sent: 245,ama2six,We were part of a Gate 1 group dining together and thoroughly enjoying not only the delicious foods but also the very efficient wait service and welcoming atmosphere. If we were here longer, there would be a second visit to Soul Ben Thanh!\n",

      "Sent: 249,Joanne Olsen,We stumbled upon this restaurant after a busy morning at the markets bartering and buying. We were looking for a place to have a nice cold beer. The staff were so helpful and nothing seemed a problem. We decided whilst there to have a look at the menu. It looked great.... so we ordered a couple of dishes that where very tasty.

      "Sent: 272,Kristjan V,A yet undiscovered jewel of the Ben Than market area, this place offers food and drinks at a completely unbelievable price (Saigon beer for 19'000). The view is great - you can see the market, the skyscrapers and the surrounding areas. Our waiter spoke English but not sure of the rest of the staff. The place is small and you need to go through the hostel to reach the lift.\n",
      "Sent: 273,Janine Stuart,Food was great. Awesome spot to sit and watch the traffic roll by. Staff were fantastic\n",

      "Sent: 284,Sandra Reinsma,Terrible service and yelling at new staff...very poor customer service...mandatory tip which they did not deserve as we first waited an hour before anyone came to the table.

      "Sent: 293,Alex Sieber,don't come here as long as the prices are that high... the food was not bad but what we paid for it was a total rip off, 530k for fried noodles, sweet and sour pork + 2 diet cokes\n",
      "Sent: 294,Mike M,Very pricey even by tourist prices. Other expensive places use metal or grass straws but here they use plastic straws. So you're paying to harm the environment. The food was not bad though the portions were small.\n",

      "Sent: 297,Siddhant Bahadur,The food was good but slightly pricey and the waitress took our order wrong. Ultimately, the restaurant didn't do anything about that. Furthermore, be wary: The restaurant gives you a 10% discount for giving them 5 stars, hence I am hesitant of the high ratings of this restaurant.\n",
      "Sent: 298,Nathalie Choubineh,Good food. Friendly people. But pricy and the service a bit chaotic. Staff need training and experience.\n",
